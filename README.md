# :microscope: ImageJ/Fiji Macros

My personal collection of macros for image processing in
[ImageJ](https://imagej.github.io/)/[Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).

- [SyncAndCombineStacks.ijm](SyncAndCombineStacks.ijm): Synchronize and combine
  two image stacks. Useful for pairing time-lapse movies.
- [EnhanceContrastForAllChannels.ijm](EnhanceContrastForAllChannels.ijm):
  Quickly enhance the contrast of every channel in a stack. 
- [SplitTimepoints.ijm](SplitTimepoints.ijm): Save individual timepoints of a
  large timelapse dataset to directory.
- [QuickMembraneSegmentation.ijm](QuickMembraneSegmentation.ijm): Segment and
  label cells in a single image using
  [MorphoLibJ](https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ).
- [MembraneWatershed.ijm](MembraneWatershed.ijm): Segment cells in image stack
  and generate watershed lines for downstream analyses.
- [MembraneAnalyze.ijm](MembraneAnalyze.ijm): Analyze cell morphometry in image
  stack and color-code labels based on measurements.
