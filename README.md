# :microscope: ImageJ/Fiji Macros

My personal collection of macros for image processing in
[ImageJ](https://imagej.github.io/)/[Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).

- [SyncAndCombineStacks.ijm](SyncAndCombineStacks.ijm): Synchronize and combine
  two image stacks. Useful for pairing time-lapse movies.
- [EnhanceContrastForAllChannels.ijm](EnhanceContrastForAllChannels.ijm):
  Quickly enhance the contrast of every channel in a stack. 
- [SplitTimepoints.ijm](SplitTimepoints.ijm): Save individual timepoints of a
  large timelapse dataset to directory.
- [QuickMembraneSegmentation.ijm](QuickMembraneSegmentation.ijm): Simple
  workflow to segment and label cells using
  [MorphoLibJ](https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ).
