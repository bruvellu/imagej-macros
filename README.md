# :microscope: ImageJ/Fiji Macros

My personal collection of macros for image processing in
[ImageJ](https://imagej.github.io/)/[Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).

- [SyncAndCombineStacks.ijm](SyncAndCombineStacks.ijm): Synchronize and combine
  two image stacks. Useful for pairing time-lapse movies.
- [EnhanceContrastForAllChannels.ijm](EnhanceContrastForAllChannels.ijm):
  Quickly enhance the contrast of every channel in a stack.
